This game will be entirely console based.

Implementation plan/suggestions:

1: Create a variable for the user choice
2: Make a prompt for the variable to be inserted.
3: Filter the variable, so it can be compared to possible options.
4: Create a variable for the PC choice
5: Create another variable for random int, which would be 1-3
6: Fix each option for PC variable, example if randomINT = 3,
PCvar = rock, etc.
7: Create a variable to store the player score 
8: Compare PlayerChoice and PCvar and create conditionals.
9: Save scores and create an option to reset game.
